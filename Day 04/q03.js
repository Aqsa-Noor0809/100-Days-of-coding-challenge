var names = ["Musfirah", "Hafsa", "Biya"];
console.log("Hey there ".concat(names[0], ", How's your coding going on?"));
// 2) sir's way:
for (var _i = 0, names_1 = names; _i < names_1.length; _i++) {
    var name_1 = names_1[_i];
    console.log("Hello ".concat(name_1, ", Would you like to learn some typescript today?"));
}
;
